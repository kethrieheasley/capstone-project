# Capstone-Project
In this capstone research, we were tasked with finding a new variable to enhance and improve the college admissions process.  We were provided both admission and financial aid data from our college, Saint Vincent, located in Latrobe, Pennsylvania.  When COVID-19 hit in spring of 2020, Saint Vincent decided to no longer require SAT/ACT scores to be submitted by hopeful applicants.  Since SAT/ACT scores are typically the best way tp predict an applicant's college success, as well as award financial aid, Saint Vincent needs to update their admissions process.  We are using our data science and data analytics knowledge in order to evaluate and and make this data comprehennsible, and find a possible new variable to improve the admissions process.
