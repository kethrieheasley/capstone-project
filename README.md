# The purpose of this study is to use 
data science methods to study the 
implications of the change in
 Saint Vincent College’s admission 
policy to test-optional applications.
 Specifically, three cohorts 
(students beginning in 2019-2021)
 are analyzed to study relationships 
between a variety of academic outcomes
 and whether or not the student submitted 
a test score.  In addition, the data and found 
patterns are used to identify alternative
 criteria to test scores for admission and 
scholarship decisions. To answer these questions,
 we analyze the deidentified 2019-2021 cohorts’ 
admissions data by performing logistic regression,
 correlation analysis, and other classification 
methods.
